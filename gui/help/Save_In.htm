  <P>
   Enter the name of a data set in which a part of the analysis, such as 
   fitted values and residuals, predictions, confidence intervals, or 
   standard errors, is saved. If an object with the name you enter does 
   not already exist (in database 1), then it is created. If you enter 
   the name of a data set that already exists (in database 1) and this 
   data set has the same number of rows as the number of observations 
   used in the model fit, then the saved values are appended to this 
   data set. This allows you to keep fitted values from a model with the 
   original data or to keep the residuals from a number of different 
   models for the same data in one data set. If you give the name of an 
   existing <SPAN STYLE="font-variant : small-caps;">S-Plus</SPAN> 
   object that is not a data set or is not the appropriate size, then a 
   warning is issued and a modified name is used.</P>
  <P CLASS="ms-body">
   <SPAN STYLE="font-weight : bold;">Tip:</SPAN> You may want to specify 
   the same data set as on the Model page. This allows easy plotting of 
   the fitted values or residuals with the original data.
