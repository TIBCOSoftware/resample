<H3>Sample Observations or Residuals</H3>
<P>
Select the sampling method.
The default, "observations", does ordinary bootstrap sampling
of observations.  The alternative, "residuals", fits a model,
then resamples the residuals.
<p>
The "observations" method resamples observations.  
This corresponds to situations where both the
explanatory and response variables are randomly sampled.
<p>
Bootstrapping observations give
poor results when some explanatory variables are factors with some
rare levels.  For example, if one level of a factor occurs in only 5
observations, in any given bootstrap sample there could be even fewer,
and coefficients that depend on that factor could vary wildly.  If
there is a bootstrap sample with zero observations with that level,
then some coefficients cannot be estimated.
<p>
The same problems occur when the model includes interactions between
factors, and some combination of levels is rare.
<p>
Bootstrapping residuals corresponds to situations where the explanatory
variables are determined in advance (e.g. in a designed experiment),
and only the response variable is random.
<p>
The "residuals" method assumes that the residual distribution is the same
for every observation, in particular:
<li> that the residual variance is the same everywhere
<li> that the model fits, e.g. that there is not curvature that causes
the residuals to have different means for different observations.
<p>
Suppose that the model does not fit.  In this case bootstrapping
observations should give standard errors and other inferences for the
combination of procedure (linear) and distribution (nonlinear) that
holds in reality, reflecting the variability that would occur if you
repeat this combination, rather than giving answers for a theoretical
linear model that does not fit reality.
Bootstrapping residuals would give an inflated standard error.
<p>
When resampling residuals, some bootstrap methods should not be used,
in particular BCa and Tilting confidence intervals.
