<H3>Jackknife After Bootstrap</H3>
<P>
Jackknife-after-bootstrap (JAB) is a technique applied to the results of a 
bootstrap analysis, to determine how sensitive the bootstrap estimates
are to the original random sample of data.
<p>
Suppose, for example, that the Functional is "SE" (standard error).
In other words, one of the things estimated from bootstrap sampling
is the standard error of your statistic.  JAB lets you investigate
the following things about the estimated standard error:
<li> <b>sensitivity</b>:  how sensitive is the estimated standard
error to each of the observations in your original data set?
<li> <b>bias</b> and <b>standard error</b>:  provides estimates of
the bias and standard error, due to random sampling, of the
estimated standard error of your statistic.
<li> <b>correlation</b>:  is there correlation between the original
statistic (calculated leaving out one original observation at a time)
and the functional (calculated from a bootstrap distribution leaving
out one original observation at a time).
Nonzero correlation between the functional "SE" and the statistic suggests
a relationship between the statistic and its standard error,
so that symmetric confidence intervals would be inaccurate.
