<h2>Data and Statistic Details</h2>

This page gives details for the <b>Data</b> and
<b>Statistic</b> fields
as well as how to pass additional arguments to the statistic
The fields are found on the "Model"
tab for the <b>Bootstrap</b>, 
<b>Jackknife and Influence</b>, 
and <b>Permutation Test</b> menus.


<H3>Data Set</H3>
<p>
Specify the data to resample. This may be a vector, 
matrix, or data frame.
<p>
It may also be a model object, e.g. created by a call to
<code>lm</code>.  The object must contain a <code>call</code>
component that indicates the name of the data originally used
to create the object.

<H3>Statistic to Estimate</H3>
<P>
In the
<b>Expression</b> field, specify
the expression describing the statistic to be resampled.
this may be a function that accepts data as the first 
argument,
or an expression that calculates the statistic.
<p>
The statistic should normally return a numerical object, a vector
or matrix.  However, it may return NULL, when resampling for graphics
rather than for numerical calculations.

<h4>Function</h4>
One choice is to give the name of a function,
such as <code>mean</code> or <code>colMeans</code>.
<p>
If the <b>Data Set</b> is a model object, then the statistic
should be a function like <code>coef</code> that operates on the
model object.
<p>
If you need to pass arguments to the statistic, pass them using
<code>args.statistics</code> in the <b>Additional Arguments</b> field.
For example,
<br>
<code>args.statistics=list(trim=.1)</code>
<br>
If you want to resample a function for which the data is the
second argument, then pass the first argument using
<code>args.statistics</code>; the data is passed as the first
first argument that is not passed by name using <code>args.statistics</code>.

<h4>Expression</h4>
Often it is more convenient to give an expression that calculates
the statistic.  For example, 
<br>
<code>mean(x, trim = .1)</code>
<br>
calculates the trimmed mean of <code>x</code>.
<p>
Using an expression is particularly convenient when the data is
a data frame, because you can refer to variables by name, without
explicitly subscripting them.
For example, if the data is <code>fuel.frame</code>, then you may
use e.g.
<br>
<code>mean(Fuel, trim = .1)</code>
<br>
which is actually a shortcut for
<br>
<code>mean(fuel.frame$Fuel, trim = .1)</code>
<br>

<p>If the <b>Data Set</b> is given by name, e.g.
<code>lottery.payoff</code>, then just use its name, e.g.
<br>
<code>mean(lottery.payoff, trim = .1)</code>
<br>
However, if the <b>Data Set</b> is given as an expression that
computes a data set, e.g.
<code>ethanol[1:45, "NOx"]</code>, then use the name
<code>data</code> to refer to the data, e.g.
<br>
<code>mean(data, trim = .1)</code>
<br>
