<P>
Select this to print bootstrap tilting confidence intervals for the
statistic under consideration.
<p>
Note that tilting confidence intervals are generally more 
accurate than using percentiles as confidence intervals.
However, for small samples from nonlinear statistics, the current
implementation may give inaccurate results.
<p>
Tilting intervals have much smaller simulation variation than other
confidence intervals.  For example, they require approximately 1/37
times as many bootstrap samples as do BCa intervals, for comparable
simulation accuracy (for 95% intervals).
