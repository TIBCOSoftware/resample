<H3>Linear Approximation</H3>
<P>
Specify a method for calculating a linear approximation to the
statistic being resampled.  This is used for determining the
acceleration for BCa confidence intervals, for calculating tilting
confidence intervals and diagnostics, and other uses.
<p>
The basic methods are:
<br>
<code>jackknife</code>: calculated by leaving out one observation
at at time
<br>
<code>influence</code>: empirical influence function, calculated using
a small epsilon,
<br>
<code>regression</code>: calculated by regression of resampled statistic
values vs the frequencies of observations in the resamples, and
<br>
<code>ace</code>: like regression, except after the first regression,
a nonlinear transformation is applied to the "y" (resampled statistic)
values, and a second regression is run.
<p>
In addition,
<br>
<code>choose</code>: indicates to choose one of the above choices,
based on the sample size, number of resamples, and other factors.
<br>
<code>none</code>: prevents a linear approximation from being 
calculated and saved (it is calculated if needed in any case).

<h4>Formula</h4>
Normally the <code>regression</code> and <code>ace</code> regress
against observed frequencies.  This regression has 
<it>n-1</it> explanatory variables, where <it>n</it> is the number
of observations in the data set.  If <it>n</it> is large and the
number of bootstrap samples is small the results may be inaccurate.
You may specify the explanatory variables using a formula instead;
e.g. if the statistic is variance, then a suitable formula
would be <code>~x + x^2</code>, where <code>x</code> is the variable
being resampled.
