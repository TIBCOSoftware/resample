<P>Enter the name of the object in which to save the results of the analysis. If an object with this name already exists, its contents are overwritten. This must be a valid S-PLUS object name—any combination of alphanumeric characters that starts with an alpha character is allowed. The only non-alphanumeric character allowed is the period “.”. Names are case-sensitive, so X and x are different names. If there are any columns of class factor in the data set, then this object is a list with two matrices. If no columns are of class factor, or if factor summaries were not requested, then this object is a list with one component.</P>
