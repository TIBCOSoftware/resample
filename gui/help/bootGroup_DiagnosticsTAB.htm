<H3>Tilt After Bootstrap</H3>
<P>
Tilt-after-bootstrap (TAB) is a technique applied to the results of a 
bootstrap analysis, to determine how sensitive the bootstrap estimates
are to the original random sample of data, and in particular, whether
there is a relationship between the statistic value and the bootstrap estimate.
<p>
Suppose, for example, that the Functional is "SE" (standard error).
In other words, one of the things estimated from bootstrap sampling
is the standard error of your statistic.  Is there a relationship
between the estimated standard error, and the true parameter (what the statistic
is estimating)?
<p>
Consider a simple example--estimating a single proportion from a random sample.
The standard error is sqrt(<em>P</em> (1-<em>P</em>)/<em>n</em>) 
(that is the usual standard error formula;
your bootstrap standard error will differ slightly due to random sampling),
where <em>P</em> is the estimated proportion from the sample.
Note the relationship between <em>P</em> and the standard error.
<p>
Bootstrap tilting estimates such relationships in a nonparametric way.
<p>
If there is a relationship between standard error and the statistic,
then symmetric confidence intervals for the statistic are inaccurate
(because they assume that the standard error is constant, not related
to the statistic), and BCa or tilting confidence intervals
should be more accurate.
