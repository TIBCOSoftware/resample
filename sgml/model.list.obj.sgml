Model List Object 
</s-title>
<s-description>
Objects of class <code>model.list</code> are typically produced as a 
side-effect of the model-fitting process in 
<s-function name="lm.sgm">lm</s-function>, 
<s-function name="glm.sgm">glm</s-function> 
and 
<s-function name="censorReg.sgm">censorReg</s-function>. 
They exist somewhere between the data contained in a 
<s-function name="model.frame.sgm">model.frame</s-function> 
object and the actual fitted model object. 
</s-description>

<s-section name="GENERATION">
This class of objects is returned from fitting routines by specifying 
<code>method=model.list</code> in the calling sequence. 
</s-section>

<s-section name="METHODS">
The following generic functions have methods for <code>model.list</code>: 
<br>
<s-function name="lm.sgm">lm</s-function>, 
<s-function name="glm.sgm">glm</s-function>, 
<s-function name="censorReg.sgm">censorReg</s-function>. 
</s-section>

<s-section name="INHERITANCE">
The class <code>model.list</code> inherits from 
<s-function name="list.sgm">list</s-function>. 
</s-section>

<s-value>
All model lists have the same basic structure:
a <code>"data"</code> component containing the data to be fit; 
a <code>"formula"</code> component containing the model formula;
a <code>"call"</code> component containing the call generating the model list
and a <code>"fit"</code> component containing other data needed
to perform the fit. 
<p>
The components differ from one modeling function to another,
but an important common sub-component of <code>"fit"</code>
is <code>"fitexpr"</code>, which contains the expression to 
actually compute the fit of the data contained in the model list. 
See the default method for a given modeling function to see the exact 
structure of the <code>"fit"</code> component. 
<p>
The <code>"data"</code> component of a model list typically contains 
sub-components such as 
<s-return-component name="X">
the explanatory variables and their values 
</s-return-component>
<s-return-component name="Y">
the response variable values 
</s-return-component>
<s-return-component name="weights">
weights used in the fit, if any 
<p>
The <code>"data"</code> component is further described below. 
</s-return-component>
</s-value>

<s-details>
The <code>model.list</code> object was 
created to support resampling functions such as 
<s-function name="bootstrap.sgm">bootstrap</s-function>, 
which may call model fitting routines such as 
<s-function name="lm.sgm">lm</s-function> 
thousands of times.  The 
construction of a fitted model object from scratch follows three basic 
steps:  constructing the model frame from the data; extracting the 
relevant pieces from the model frame; and performing the 
fit.  The first two steps are redundant from the point of view of 
resampling.  Therefore the data from the second step, along with 
other parameters and expressions needed to perform the fit, has been 
organized into the <code>model.list</code> object.  During resampling, the 
<code>model.list</code> is created once, then repeatedly resampled and fit using 
<code>model.list</code> methods for fitting routines ( 
<s-function name="lm.model.list.sgm">lm.model.list</s-function>, 
for example). 
<p>
A model list can be returned by fitting routines (without fitting) via 
the <code>method</code> argument. 
<p>
The <code>"data"</code> component of a <code>model.list</code> object 
contains those data that are expected to be sampled with 
replacement by the resampling functions.  All other 
non-sample-specific data should be in component <code>"fit"</code>.  This 
principle, which one should keep in mind when designing 
model lists for other modeling functions, is born out in the 
subscripting method for model.lists: 
the result of, for example <code>ml[rind,]</code>, where <code>ml</code> is a model.list and 
<code>rind</code> a set of indices, is a model.list whose data component contains 
the <code>rind</code> selected rows of the original data components,
and whose other components are unchanged.
