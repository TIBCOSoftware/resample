<s-args-required>
<s-arg name="replicates">
matrix containing the bootstrapped statistic values, 
with <code>B</code> rows (the number of bootstrap samples) and 
one or more columns (for univariate or multivariate statistics). 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="indices">
matrix containing resampling indices, with <code>B</code> columns, 
and normally with <code>n</code> rows (the number of observations or subjects 
in the original data). 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="n">
number of observations (or subjects, if sampling by subject). 
By default this is set to <code>max(indices)</code>, but it is better to supply it. 
</s-arg>
</s-args-required>
<s-args-optional>
<s-arg name="model.mat">
model matrix, with one row for each observation (or subject) and columns 
which together will yield a high multiple correlation with the statistic 
of interest. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="formula">
a formula object, with the response on the left of a <code>~</code> 
operator, and the terms, separated by <code>+</code> operators, on the 
right.  Used to create the model matrix; if supplied then <code>model.mat</code> 
is ignored. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="data">
a data.frame in which to interpret the variables named in the 
formula. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="group">
the <code>group</code> vector, if the original resampling was by group. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="subject">
the <code>subject</code> vector, if the original resampling was by subject. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="weights">
vector of length <code>B</code>, importance sampling weights. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="transform">
logical, if <code>TRUE</code> (the default) then after an initial regression 
transform the response variable (the replicates) to obtain a more 
linear relationship with the predicted values, and perform a second 
regression. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="df">
degrees of freedom to for the transformation; this is passed to 
<s-function name="smooth.spline.sgm">smooth.spline</s-function>. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="details">
logical, if <code>TRUE</code> (the default) then attach the multiple correlation 
of the (transformed) <code>replicates</code> and the predicted values as an 
attribute when returning the linear approximation values. 
</s-arg>
<s-arg name="...">
not currently used. 
</s-arg>
</s-args-optional>
<s-value>
vector or matrix containing 
approximate empirical influence function values for each data point. 
<p>
In the univariate case a vector <code>L</code> such that 
<br>
        <code>replicates[i] ~= c + mean(L[indices[,i]])</code> 
<br>
where <code>c</code> is the statistic value for the observed data. 
<p>
In the multivariate case this relationship holds for each column. 
<p>
There are <code>n</code> rows, where <code>n</code> is the original number of observations 
or subjects; and <code>p</code> columns, where the 
statistic is <code>p</code>-valued.   In the subject case the 
rows names of the result are the unique values of the 
<code>subject</code> argument taken from the call to 
<s-function name="bootstrap.sgm">bootstrap</s-function> 
or 
<s-function name="jackknife.sgm">jackknife</s-function>. 
<p>
The results are normalized to sum to zero 
(by group, if sampling by <code>group</code>; see below). 
<p>
If <code>details==TRUE</code> the result has a 
<code>"correlation"</code> attribute giving the multiple correlation between 
(transformed) bootstrap replicates and the linear approximation. 
</s-value>
<s-details>
This function is normally called by <code>resampGetL.bootstrap</code>, but may 
also be called directly. 
<p>
The <code>model.mat</code> matrix should have one row for each observation 
(or for each subject). 
An initial column of 1's is optional (it is added if not present). 
It should contain columns which together 
have a high "multiple correlation" with the statistic of interest. 
For example, if the statistic is <code>var(x)</code>, then <code>cbind(x, x^2)</code> 
or <code>cbind(x, (x-mean(x))^2)</code> would be suitable. 
Here  "multiple correlation" is between 
the original bootstrapped statistic (<code>replicates</code>) 
and the (multivariate) bootstrapped sample means of the model matrix, 
using the same bootstrap indices. 
In other words, you can view each column of the model matrix as a set 
of data whose sample mean is bootstrapped; these sample means 
should have high multiple correlation with the actual statistics 
in order for the resulting linear approximations to be accurate. 
<p>
The <code>indices</code> argument normally has <code>n</code> rows. 
However, it may have more or less, when bootstrap sampling with size 
not equal to the original sample size. 
Or, in permutation testing for two-sample problems, this may be 
the indices corresponding to just one of the samples.

### Example: correlation for bivariate data 
set.seed(1); x <- rmvnorm(100, d=2, rho=.5) 
bfit2 <- bootstrap(x, cor(x[,1], x[,2]), save.indices=T) 
L1 <- resampGetL(bfit2)  # "ace" method 
L2 <- resampGetL(bfit2, model.mat = cbind(x, x^2, x[,1]*x[,2])) 
L3 <- linearApproxReg(bfit2$replicates, bfit2$indices) 
L4 <- linearApproxReg(bfit2$replicates, bfit2$indices, 
                      model.mat = cbind(x, x^2, x[,1]*x[,2])) 
# L1 and L3 are identical; L2 and L4 are identical.
