<s-details>
Suppose one were to modify the original empirical distribution by 
placing unequal weights on the observations.  As the weights change, 
both the statistic calculated from the weighted distribution, and 
the bootstrap distribution obtained by sampling with probabilities 
equal to those weights, change.  Bootstrap tilting looks at the relationships 
between the statistic and summaries ("functionals") of the bootstrap 
distribution, as the weights change.  In particular, the weights 
are selected by exponential or maximum likelihood tilting; 
these approximately maximize the change in the statistic given the 
distance (forward or backward Kullback-Leibler distance) between 
the weights and the original equal weights. 
<p>
Assuming that the weighted statistic can be calculated, the most 
generally useful plot is of the functional (such as quantiles of 
the weighted bootstrap distribution) against the weighted statistics. 
<p>
For example, when considering use of a inference procedure such as 
t-tests or confidence intervals that assumes that standard errors are 
independent of the statistic, it is useful to check that assumption by 
plotting either "Centered Quantiles" or "SE" (standard error) against 
the statistic.
