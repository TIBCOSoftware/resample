Description: The resample package included functions for resampling, including
  * bootstrap
  * jackknife
  * permutation tests
  * cross validation
  * bootstrap estimation of prediction errors
  * bootstrap tilting
   A wide variety of statistics, and sampling methods are supported,
 including one- and two-sample applications, stratified sampling,
 sampling by subject, regression, time series, and finite populations.
   A feature of this code is bootstrap tilting, which generally provides
 very accurate (second-order accurate) confidence intervals, with
 better finite-sample performance than other bootstrap methods, and require
 only 1/17 or 1/37 as many bootstrap replications as other bootstrap
 methods (for 95% confidence intervals), e.g. 60 replications instead
 of 1000 or 2000.
